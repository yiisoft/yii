Data Caching
============

Data caching is about storing some PHP variable in cache and retrieving it
later from cache. For this purpose, the cache component base class [CCache]
provides two methods that are used most of the time: [set()|CCache::set]
and [get()|CCache::get].

To store a variable `$value` in cache, we choose a unique ID and call
[set()|CCache::set] to store it:

~~~
[php]
Yii::app()->cache->set($id, $value);
~~~

The cached data will remain in the cache forever unless it is removed
because of some caching policy (e.g. caching space is full and the oldest
data are removed). To change this behavior, we can also supply an
expiration parameter when calling [set()|CCache::set] so that the data will
be removed from the cache after a certain period of time:

~~~
[php]
// keep the value in cache for at most 30 seconds
Yii::app()->cache->set($id, $value, 30);
~~~

Later when we need to access this variable (in either the same or a
different Web request), we call [get()|CCache::get] with the ID to retrieve
it from cache. If the value returned is false, it means the value is not
available in cache and we should regenerate it.

~~~
[php]
$value=Yii::app()->cache->get($id);
if($value===false)
{
	// regenerate $value because it is not found in cache
	// and save it in cache for later use:
	// Yii::app()->cache->set($id,$value);
}
~~~

When choosing the ID for a variable to be cached, make sure the ID is
unique among all other variables that may be cached in the application. It
is NOT required that the ID is unique across applications because the cache
component is intelligent enough to differentiate IDs for different
applications.

Some cache storages, such as MemCache, APC, support retrieving
multiple cached values in a batch mode, which may reduce the overhead involved
in retrieving cached data. Starting from version 1.0.8, a new method named
[mget()|CCache::mget] is provided to exploit this feature. In case the underlying
cache storage does not support this feature, [mget()|CCache::mget] will still
simulate it.

To remove a cached value from cache, call [delete()|CCache::delete]; and
to remove everything from cache, call [flush()|CCache::flush]. Be very
careful when calling [flush()|CCache::flush] because it also removes cached
data that are from other applications.

> Tip: Because [CCache] implements `ArrayAccess`, a cache component can be
> used liked an array. The followings are some examples:
> ~~~
> [php]
> $cache=Yii::app()->cache;
> $cache['var1']=$value1;  // equivalent to: $cache->set('var1',$value1);
> $value2=$cache['var2'];  // equivalent to: $value2=$cache->get('var2');
> ~~~

Cache Dependency
----------------

Besides expiration setting, cached data may also be invalidated according
to some dependency changes. For example, if we are caching the content of
some file and the file is changed, we should invalidate the cached copy and
read the latest content from the file instead of the cache.

We represent a dependency as an instance of [CCacheDependency] or its
child class. We pass the dependency instance along with the data to be
cached when calling [set()|CCache::set].

~~~
[php]
// the value will expire in 30 seconds
// it may also be invalidated earlier if the dependent file is changed
Yii::app()->cache->set($id, $value, 30, new CFileCacheDependency('FileName'));
~~~

Now if we retrieve `$value` from cache by calling [get()|CCache::get], the
dependency will be evaluated and if it is changed, we will get a false
value, indicating the data needs to be regenerated.

Below is a summary of the available cache dependencies:

   - [CFileCacheDependency]: the dependency is changed if the file's last
modification time is changed.

   - [CDirectoryCacheDependency]: the dependency is changed if any of the
files under the directory and its subdirectories is changed.

   - [CDbCacheDependency]: the dependency is changed if the query result
of the specified SQL statement is changed.

   - [CGlobalStateCacheDependency]: the dependency is changed if the value
of the specified global state is changed. A global state is a variable that
is persistent across multiple requests and multiple sessions in an
application. It is defined via [CApplication::setGlobalState()].

   - [CChainedCacheDependency]: the dependency is changed if any of the
dependencies on the chain is changed.

   - [CExpressionDependency]: the dependency is changed if the result of
the specified PHP expression is changed. This class has been available
since version 1.0.4.
