Relational Active Record
========================

We have already seen how to use Active Record (AR) to select data from a
single database table. In this section, we describe how to use AR to join
several related database tables and bring back the joint data set.

In order to use relational AR, it is required that primary-foreign key
relationships are well defined between tables that need to be joined. AR
relies on the metadata about these relationships to determine how to join
the tables. For simplicity, we will use the database schema shown in the
following entity-relationship (ER) diagram to illustrate examples in this
section.

Declaring Relationship
----------------------

Before we use AR to perform relational query, we need to let AR know how
one AR class is related with another.

Relationship between two AR classes is directly associated with the
relationship between the database tables represented by the AR classes.
From database point of view, a relationship between two tables A and B has
three types: one-to-many (e.g. `Author` and `Post`), one-to-one (e.g.
`User` and `Profile`) and many-to-many (e.g. `Category` and `Post`). In AR,
there are four types of relationships:

   - `BELONGS_TO`: if the relationship between table A and B is
one-to-many, then B belongs to A (e.g. `Post` belongs to `Author`);

   - `HAS_MANY`: if the relationship between table A and B is one-to-many,
then A has many B (e.g. `Author` has many `Post`);

   - `HAS_ONE`: this is special case of `HAS_MANY` where A has at most one
B (e.g. `Author` has at most one `Profile`);

   - `MANY_MANY`: this corresponds to the many-to-many relationship in
database. An associative table is needed to break a many-to-many
relationship into one-to-many relationships, as most DBMS do not support
many-to-many relationship directly. In our example database schema, the
`PostCategory` serves for this purpose. In AR terminology, we can explain
`MANY_MANY` as the combination of `BELONGS_TO` and `HAS_MANY`. For example,
`Post` belongs to many `Category` and `Category` has many `Post`.

Declaring relationship in AR involves overriding the
[relations()|CActiveRecord::relations] method of [CActiveRecord]. The
method returns an array of relationship configurations. Each array element
represents a single relationship with the following format:

~~~
[php]
'VarName'=>array('RelationType', 'ClassName', 'ForeignKey', ...additional options)
~~~

where `VarName` is the name of the relationship; `RelationType` specifies
the type of the relationship, which can be one of the four constants:
`self::BELONGS_TO`, `self::HAS_ONE`, `self::HAS_MANY` and
`self::MANY_MANY`; `ClassName` is the name of the AR class related to this
AR class; and `ForeignKey` specifies the foreign key(s) involved in the
relationship. Additional options can be specified at the end for each
relationship (to be described later).

The following code shows how we declare the relationships for the `Author`
and `Post` classes.

~~~
[php]
class Post extends CActiveRecord
{
	public function relations()
	{
		return array(
			'author'=>array(self::BELONGS_TO, 'Author', 'authorID'),
			'categories'=>array(self::MANY_MANY, 'Category', 'PostCategory(postID, categoryID)'),
		);
	}
}

class Author extends CActiveRecord
{
	public function relations()
	{
		return array(
			'posts'=>array(self::HAS_MANY, 'Post', 'authorID'),
			'profile'=>array(self::HAS_ONE, 'Profile', 'ownerID'),
		);
	}
}
~~~

> Info: A foreign key may be composite, consisting of two or more columns.
In this case, we should concatenate the names of the foreign key columns
and separate them with space or comma. For `MANY_MANY` relationship type,
the associative table name must also be specified in the foreign key. For
example, the `categories` relationship in `Post` is specified with the
foreign key `PostCategory(postID, categoryID)`.

The declaration of relationships in an AR class implicitly adds a property
to the class for each relationship. After a relational query is performed,
the corresponding property will be populated with the related AR
instance(s). For example, if `$author` represents an `Author` AR instance,
we can use `$author->posts` to access its related `Post` instances.

Performing Relational Query
---------------------------

The simplest way of performing relational query is by reading a relational
property of an AR instance. If the property is not accessed previously, a
relational query will be initiated, which joins the two related tables and
filters with the primary key of the current AR instance. The query result
will be saved to the property as instance(s) of the related AR class. This
is known as the *lazy loading* approach, i.e., the relational query
is performed only when the related objects are initially accessed. The
example below shows how to use this approach:

~~~
[php]
// retrieve the post whose ID is 10
$post=Post::model()->queryByPk(10);
// retrieve the post's author: a relational query will be performed here
$author=$post->author;
~~~

> Info: If there is no related instance for a relationship, the
corresponding property could be either null or an empty array. For
`BELONGS_TO` and `HAS_ONE` relationships, the result is null; for
`HAS_MANY` and `MANY_MANY`, it is an empty array.

The lazy loading approach is very convenient to use, but it is not
efficient in some scenarios. For example, if we want to access the author
information for `N` posts, using the lazy approach would involve executing
`N` join queries. We should resort to the so-called *eager loading*
approach under this circumstance.

The eager loading approach retrieves the related AR instances together
with the main AR instance(s). This is accomplished by using the
[with()|CActiveRecord::with] method together with one of the
[find|CActiveRecord::find] or [findAll|CActiveRecord::findAll] methods in
AR. For example,

~~~
[php]
$posts=Post::model()->with('author')->findAll();
~~~

The above code will return an array of `Post` instances. Unlike the lazy
approach, the `author` property in each `Post` instance is already
populated with the related `Author` instance before we access the property.
Instead of executing a join query for each post, the eager loading approach
brings back all posts together with their authors in a single join query!

We can specify multiple relationship names in the
[with()|CActiveRecord::with] method and the eager loading approach will
bring them back all in one shot. For example, the following code will bring
back posts together with their authors and categories:

~~~
[php]
$posts=Post::model()->with('author','categories')->findAll();
~~~

We can also do nested eager loading. Instead of a list of relationship
names, we pass in a hierarchical representation of relationship names to
the [with()|CActiveRecord::with] method, like the following,

~~~
[php]
$posts=Post::model()->with(array(
	'author'=>array(
		'profile',
		'posts'),
	'categories'))->findAll();
~~~

The above example will bring back all posts together with their author and
categories. It will also bring back each author's profile and posts.

> Info: The AR implementation in Yii is very efficient. When eager loading
a hierarchy of related objects involving `N` `HAS_MANY` or `MANY_MANY`
relationships, it will take `N+1` SQL queries to obtain the needed results.
This means it needs to execute 3 SQL queries in the last example because of
the `posts` and `categories` properties. Other frameworks take a more
radical approach by using only one SQL query. At first look, this approach
seems more efficient because fewer queries are being parsed and executed by
DBMS. It is in fact impractical in reality for two reasons. First, there
are many repetitive data columns in the result which takes extra time to
transmit and process. Second, the number of rows in the result set grows
exponentially with the number of tables involved, which makes it simply
unmanageable as more relationships are involved.

Relational Query Options
------------------------

We mentioned that additional options can be specified in relationship
declaration. These options, specified as name-value pairs, are used to
customize the relational query. They are summarized as below.

   - `select`: a list of columns to be selected for the related AR class.
It defaults to '*', meaning all columns. Column names should be
disambiguated using `aliasToken` if they appear in an expression (e.g.
`COUNT(??.name) AS nameCount`).

   - `condition`: the `WHERE` clause. It defaults to empty. Note, column
references need to be disambiguated using `aliasToken` (e.g. `??.id=10`).

   - `order`: the `ORDER BY` clause. It defaults to empty. Note, column
references need to be disambiguated using `aliasToken` (e.g. `??.age
DESC`).

   - `with`: a list of child related objects that should be loaded
together with this object. Note, this is only honored by lazy loading, not
eager loading.

   - `joinType`: type of join for this relationship. It defaults to `LEFT
OUTER JOIN`.

   - `aliasToken`: the column prefix for column reference disambiguation.
It defaults to `'??.'`.

In addition, the following options are available for certain relationships
during lazy loading:

   - `group`: the `GROUP BY` clause. It defaults to empty. Note, column
references need to be disambiguated using `aliasToken` (e.g. `??.age`).
This option only applies to `HAS_MANY` and `MANY_MANY` relationships.

   - `limit`: limit of the rows to be selected. This option does NOT apply
to `BELONGS_TO` relation.

   - `offset`: offset of the rows to be selected. This option does NOT
apply to `BELONGS_TO` relation.

Below we modify the `posts` relationship declaration in the `Author` by
including some of the above options:

~~~
[php]
class Author extends CActiveRecord
{
	public function relations()
	{
		return array(
			'posts'=>array(self::HAS_MANY, 'Post', 'authorID'
							'order'=>'??.createTime DESC',
							'with'=>'categories'),
			'profile'=>array(self::HAS_ONE, 'Profile', 'ownerID'),
		);
	}
}
~~~

Now if we access `$author->posts`, we would obtain the author's posts
sorted according to their creation time in descending order. Each post
instance also has its categories loaded.

> Info: When a column name appears in two or more tables being joined
together, it needs to be disambiguated. This is done by prefixing the
column name with its table name. For example, `id` becomes `Team.id`. In AR
relational queries, however, we do not have this freedom because the SQL
statements are automatically generated by AR which systematically gives
each table an alias. Therefore, in order to avoid column name conflict, we
use a placeholder to indicate the existence of a column which needs to be
disambiguated. AR will replace the placeholder with a suitable table alias
and properly disambiguate the column.
