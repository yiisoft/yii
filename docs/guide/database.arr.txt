Relational Active Record
========================

We have already seen how to use Active Record (AR) to select data from a
single database table. In this section, we describe how to use AR to join
several related database tables and bring back the joint data set.

In order to use relational AR, it is required that primary-foreign key
relationships are well defined between tables that need to be joined. AR
relies on the metadata about these relationships to determine how to join
the tables.

> Note: Starting from version 1.0.1, you can use relational AR even
> if you do not define any foreign key constraints in your database.

For simplicity, we will use the database schema shown in the
following entity-relationship (ER) diagram to illustrate examples in this
section.

> );
> ~~~
> In the above, we use `COMMENT` keyword to describe the foreign key constraint
> which can be read by AR to recognize the described relationship.



Declaring Relationship
----------------------

Before we use AR to perform relational query, we need to let AR know how
one AR class is related with another.

Relationship between two AR classes is directly associated with the
relationship between the database tables represented by the AR classes.
From database point of view, a relationship between two tables A and B has
three types: one-to-many (e.g. `User` and `Post`), one-to-one (e.g.
`User` and `Profile`) and many-to-many (e.g. `Category` and `Post`). In AR,
there are four types of relationships:

   - `BELONGS_TO`: if the relationship between table A and B is
one-to-many, then B belongs to A (e.g. `Post` belongs to `User`);

   - `HAS_MANY`: if the relationship between table A and B is one-to-many,
then A has many B (e.g. `User` has many `Post`);

   - `HAS_ONE`: this is special case of `HAS_MANY` where A has at most one
B (e.g. `User` has at most one `Profile`);

   - `MANY_MANY`: this corresponds to the many-to-many relationship in
database. An associative table is needed to break a many-to-many
relationship into one-to-many relationships, as most DBMS do not support
many-to-many relationship directly. In our example database schema, the
`PostCategory` serves for this purpose. In AR terminology, we can explain
`MANY_MANY` as the combination of `BELONGS_TO` and `HAS_MANY`. For example,
`Post` belongs to many `Category` and `Category` has many `Post`.

Declaring relationship in AR involves overriding the
[relations()|CActiveRecord::relations] method of [CActiveRecord]. The
method returns an array of relationship configurations. Each array element
represents a single relationship with the following format:

~~~
[php]
'VarName'=>array('RelationType', 'ClassName', 'ForeignKey', ...additional options)
~~~

where `VarName` is the name of the relationship; `RelationType` specifies
the type of the relationship, which can be one of the four constants:
`self::BELONGS_TO`, `self::HAS_ONE`, `self::HAS_MANY` and
`self::MANY_MANY`; `ClassName` is the name of the AR class related to this
AR class; and `ForeignKey` specifies the foreign key(s) involved in the
relationship. Additional options can be specified at the end for each
relationship (to be described later).

The following code shows how we declare the relationships for the `User`
and `Post` classes.

~~~
[php]
class Post extends CActiveRecord
{
	public function relations()
	{
		return array(
			'author'=>array(self::BELONGS_TO, 'User', 'authorID'),
			'categories'=>array(self::MANY_MANY, 'Category', 'PostCategory(postID, categoryID)'),
		);
	}
}

class User extends CActiveRecord
{
	public function relations()
	{
		return array(
			'posts'=>array(self::HAS_MANY, 'Post', 'authorID'),
			'profile'=>array(self::HAS_ONE, 'Profile', 'ownerID'),
		);
	}
}
~~~

> Info: A foreign key may be composite, consisting of two or more columns.
In this case, we should concatenate the names of the foreign key columns
and separate them with space or comma. For `MANY_MANY` relationship type,
the associative table name must also be specified in the foreign key. For
example, the `categories` relationship in `Post` is specified with the
foreign key `PostCategory(postID, categoryID)`.

The declaration of relationships in an AR class implicitly adds a property
to the class for each relationship. After a relational query is performed,
the corresponding property will be populated with the related AR
instance(s). For example, if `$author` represents a `User` AR instance,
we can use `$author->posts` to access its related `Post` instances.

Performing Relational Query
---------------------------

The simplest way of performing relational query is by reading a relational
property of an AR instance. If the property is not accessed previously, a
relational query will be initiated, which joins the two related tables and
filters with the primary key of the current AR instance. The query result
will be saved to the property as instance(s) of the related AR class. This
is known as the *lazy loading* approach, i.e., the relational query
is performed only when the related objects are initially accessed. The
example below shows how to use this approach:

~~~
[php]
// retrieve the post whose ID is 10
$post=Post::model()->findByPk(10);
// retrieve the post's author: a relational query will be performed here
$author=$post->author;
~~~

> Info: If there is no related instance for a relationship, the
corresponding property could be either null or an empty array. For
`BELONGS_TO` and `HAS_ONE` relationships, the result is null; for
`HAS_MANY` and `MANY_MANY`, it is an empty array.
Note that the `HAS_MANY` and `MANY_MANY` relationships return arrays of objects,
you will need to loop through the results before trying to access any properties.
Otherwise, you may receive "Trying to get property of non-object" errors.

The lazy loading approach is very convenient to use, but it is not
efficient in some scenarios. For example, if we want to access the author
information for `N` posts, using the lazy approach would involve executing
`N` join queries. We should resort to the so-called *eager loading*
approach under this circumstance.

The eager loading approach retrieves the related AR instances together
with the main AR instance(s). This is accomplished by using the
[with()|CActiveRecord::with] method together with one of the
[find|CActiveRecord::find] or [findAll|CActiveRecord::findAll] methods in
AR. For example,

~~~
[php]
$posts=Post::model()->with('author')->findAll();
~~~

The above code will return an array of `Post` instances. Unlike the lazy
approach, the `author` property in each `Post` instance is already
populated with the related `User` instance before we access the property.
Instead of executing a join query for each post, the eager loading approach
brings back all posts together with their authors in a single join query!

We can specify multiple relationship names in the
[with()|CActiveRecord::with] method and the eager loading approach will
bring them back all in one shot. For example, the following code will bring
back posts together with their authors and categories:

~~~
[php]
$posts=Post::model()->with('author','categories')->findAll();
~~~

We can also do nested eager loading. Instead of a list of relationship
names, we pass in a hierarchical representation of relationship names to
the [with()|CActiveRecord::with] method, like the following,

~~~
[php]
$posts=Post::model()->with(
	'author.profile',
	'author.posts',
	'categories')->findAll();
~~~

The above example will bring back all posts together with their author and
categories. It will also bring back each author's profile and posts.

> Note: The usage of the [with()|CActiveRecord::with] method has been changed
> since version 1.0.2. Please read the corresponding API documentation carefully.

The AR implementation in Yii is very efficient. When eager loading
a hierarchy of related objects involving `N` `HAS_MANY` or `MANY_MANY`
relationships, it will take `N+1` SQL queries to obtain the needed results.
This means it needs to execute 3 SQL queries in the last example because of
the `posts` and `categories` properties. Other frameworks take a more
radical approach by using only one SQL query. At first look, the radical approach
seems more efficient because fewer queries are being parsed and executed by
DBMS. It is in fact impractical in reality for two reasons. First, there
are many repetitive data columns in the result which takes extra time to
transmit and process. Second, the number of rows in the result set grows
exponentially with the number of tables involved, which makes it simply
unmanageable as more relationships are involved.

Since version 1.0.2, you can also enforce the relational query to be done with
only one SQL query. Simply append a [together()|CActiveFinder::together] call
after [with()|CActiveRecord::with]. For example,

~~~
[php]
$posts=Post::model()->with(
	'author.profile',
	'author.posts',
	'categories')->together()->findAll();
~~~

The above query will be done in one SQL query. Without calling [together|CActiveFinder::together],
this will need two SQL queries: one joins `Post`, `User` and `Profile` tables,
and the other joins `User` and `Post` tables.


Relational Query Options
------------------------

We mentioned that additional options can be specified in relationship
declaration. These options, specified as name-value pairs, are used to
customize the relational query. They are summarized as below.

   - `select`: a list of columns to be selected for the related AR class.
It defaults to '*', meaning all columns. Column names should be
disambiguated using `aliasToken` if they appear in an expression (e.g.
`COUNT(??.name) AS nameCount`).

   - `condition`: the `WHERE` clause. It defaults to empty. Note, column
references need to be disambiguated using `aliasToken` (e.g. `??.id=10`).

   - `params`: the parameters to be bound to the generated SQL statement.
This should be given as an array of name-value pairs. This option has been
available since version 1.0.3.

   - `on`: the `ON` clause. The condition specified here will be appended
to the joining condition using the `AND` operator. Note, column
references need to be disambiguated using `aliasToken` (e.g. `??.id=10`).
This option does not apply to `MANY_MANY` relations. This option has been
available since version 1.0.2.

   - `order`: the `ORDER BY` clause. It defaults to empty. Note, column
references need to be disambiguated using `aliasToken` (e.g. `??.age
DESC`).

   - `with`: a list of child related objects that should be loaded
together with this object. Be aware that using this option inappropriately
may form an infinite relation loop.

   - `joinType`: type of join for this relationship. It defaults to `LEFT
OUTER JOIN`.

   - `aliasToken`: the column prefix placeholder. It will be replaced
by the corresponding table alias to disambiguate column references.
It defaults to `'??.'`.

   - `alias`: the alias for the table associated with this relationship.
This option has been available since version 1.0.1. It defaults to null,
meaning the table alias is automatically generated. This is different
from `aliasToken` in that the latter is just a placeholder and will be
replaced by the actual table alias.

   - `together`: whether the table associated with this relationship should
be forced to join together with the primary table. This option is only meaningful for HAS_MANY and MANY_MANY relations. If this option is not set or false, each HAS_MANY or MANY_MANY relation will have their own JOIN statement to improve performance. This option has been available since version 1.0.3.

   - `group`: the `GROUP BY` clause. It defaults to empty. Note, column
references need to be disambiguated using `aliasToken` (e.g. `??.age`).

   - `having`: the `HAVING` clause. It defaults to empty. Note, column
references need to be disambiguated using `aliasToken` (e.g. `??.age`).
Note: option has been available since version 1.0.1.


In addition, the following options are available for certain relationships
during lazy loading:

   - `limit`: limit of the rows to be selected. This option does NOT apply
to `BELONGS_TO` relation.

   - `offset`: offset of the rows to be selected. This option does NOT
apply to `BELONGS_TO` relation.

Below we modify the `posts` relationship declaration in the `User` by
including some of the above options:

~~~
[php]
class User extends CActiveRecord
{
	public function relations()
	{
		return array(
			'posts'=>array(self::HAS_MANY, 'Post', 'authorID',
							'order'=>'??.createTime DESC',
							'with'=>'categories'),
			'profile'=>array(self::HAS_ONE, 'Profile', 'ownerID'),
		);
	}
}
~~~

Now if we access `$author->posts`, we would obtain the author's posts
sorted according to their creation time in descending order. Each post
instance also has its categories loaded.

> Info: When a column name appears in two or more tables being joined
together, it needs to be disambiguated. This is done by prefixing the
column name with its table name. For example, `id` becomes `Team.id`. In AR
relational queries, however, we do not have this freedom because the SQL
statements are automatically generated by AR which systematically gives
each table an alias. Therefore, in order to avoid column name conflict, we
use a placeholder to indicate the existence of a column which needs to be
disambiguated. AR will replace the placeholder with a suitable table alias
and properly disambiguate the column.

Dynamic Relational Query Options
--------------------------------

Starting from version 1.0.2, we can use dynamic relational query options
in both [with()|CActiveRecord::with] and the `with` option. The dynamic
options will overwrite existing options as specified in the [relations()|CActiveRecord::relations]
method. For example, with the above `User` model, if we want to use eager
loading approach to bring back posts belonging to an author in *ascending order*
(the `order` option in the relation specification is descending order), we
can do the following:

~~~
[php]
User::model()->with(array(
	'posts'=>array('order'=>'??.createTime ASC'),
	'profile',
))->findAll();
~~~

Starting from version 1.0.5, dynamic query options can also be used when using the lazy loading approach to perform relational query. To do so, we should call a method whose name is the same as the relation name and pass the dynamic query options as the method parameter. For example, the following code returns a user's posts whose `status` is 1:

~~~
[php]
$user=User::model()->findByPk(1);
$posts=$user->posts(array('condition'=>'status=1'));
~~~


Statistical Query
-----------------

> Note: Statistical query has been supported since version 1.0.4.

Besides the relational query described above, Yii also supports the so-called statistical query (or aggregational query). It refers to retrieving the aggregational information about the related objects, such as the number of comments for each post, the average rating for each product, etc. Statistical query can only be performed for objects related in `HAS_MANY` (e.g. a post has many comments) or `MANY_MANY` (e.g. a post belongs to many categories and a category has many posts).

Performing statistical query is very similar to performing relation query as we described before. We first need to declare the statistical query in the [relations()|CActiveRecord::relations] method of [CActiveRecord] like we do with relational query.

~~~
[php]
class Post extends CActiveRecord
{
	public function relations()
	{
		return array(
			'commentCount'=>array(self::STAT, 'Comment', 'postID'),
			'categoryCount'=>array(self::STAT, 'Category', 'PostCategory(postID, categoryID)'),
		);
	}
}
~~~

In the above, we declare two statistical queries: `commentCount` calculates the number of comments belonging to a post, and `categoryCount` calculates the number of categories that a post belongs to. Note that the relationship between `Post` and `Comment` is `HAS_MANY`, while the relationship between `Post` and `Category` is `MANY_MANY` (with the joining table `PostCategory`). As we can see, the declaration is very similar to those relations we described in earlier subsections. The only difference is that the relation type is `STAT` here.


With the above declaration, we can retrieve the number of comments for a post using the expression `$post->commentCount`. When we access this property for the first time, a SQL statement will be executed implicitly to retrieve the corresponding result. As we already know, this is the so-called *lazy loading* approach. We can also use the *eager loading* approach if we need to determine the comment count for multiple posts:

~~~
[php]
$posts=Post::model()->with('commentCount', 'categoryCount')->findAll();
~~~

The above statement will execute three SQLs to bring back all posts together with their comment counts and category counts. Using the lazy loading approach, we would end up with `2*N+1` SQL queries if there are `N` posts.

By default, a statistical query will calculate the `COUNT` expression (and thus the comment count and category count in the above example). We can customize it by specifying additional options when we declare it in [relations()|CActiveRecord::relations]. The available options are summarized as below.

   - `select`: the statistical expression. Defaults to `COUNT(*)`, meaning the count of child objects.

   - `defaultValue`: the value to be assigned to those records that do not receive a statistical query result. For example, if a post does not have any comments, its `commentCount` would receive this value. The default value for this option is 0.

   - `condition`: the `WHERE` clause. It defaults to empty.

   - `params`: the parameters to be bound to the generated SQL statement.
This should be given as an array of name-value pairs.

   - `order`: the `ORDER BY` clause. It defaults to empty.

   - `group`: the `GROUP BY` clause. It defaults to empty.

   - `having`: the `HAVING` clause. It defaults to empty.


Relational Query with Named Scopes
----------------------------------

> Note: The support for named scopes has been available since version 1.0.5.

Relational query can also be performed in combination with [named scopes](/doc/guide/database.ar#named-scopes). It comes in two forms. In the first form, named scopes are applied to the main model. In the second form, named scopes are applied to the related models.

The following code shows how to apply named scopes to the main model.

~~~
[php]
$posts=Post::model()->published()->recently()->with('comments')->findAll();
~~~

This is very similar to non-relational queries. The only difference is that we have the `with()` call after the named-scope chain. This query would bring back recently published posts together with their comments.

And the following code shows how to apply named scopes to the related models.

~~~
[php]
$posts=Post::model()->with('comments:recently:approved')->findAll();
~~~

The above query will bring back all posts together with their approved comments. Note that `comments` refers to the relation name, while `recently` and `approved` refer to two named scopes declared in the `Comment` model class. The relation name and the named scopes should be separated by colons.

Named scopes can also be specified in the `with` option of the relational rules declared in [CActiveRecord::relations()]. In the following example, if we access `$user->posts`, it would bring back all *approved* comments of the posts.

~~~
[php]
class User extends CActiveRecord
{
	public function relations()
	{
		return array(
			'posts'=>array(self::HAS_MANY, 'Post', 'authorID',
				'with'=>'comments:approved'),
		);
	}
}
~~~

> Note: Named scopes applied to related models must be specified in [CActiveRecord::scopes]. As a result, they cannot be parameterized.
