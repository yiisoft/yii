Logging
=======

Yii provides a flexible and extensible logging feature. Messages logged
can be classified according to log levels and message categories. Using
level and category filters, selected messages can be further routed to
different destinations, such as files, emails, browser windows, etc.

Message Logging
---------------

Messages can be logged by calling either [Yii::log] or [Yii::trace]. The
difference between these two methods is that the latter logs a message only
when the application is in [debug mode](/doc/guide/basics.entry#debug).

~~~
[php]
Yii::log($message, $level, $category);
Yii::trace($message, $category);
~~~

When logging a message, we need to specify its category and level.
Category is a string in the format of `xxx.yyy.zzz` which resembles to the
[path alias](/doc/guide/basics.namespace). For example, if a message is
logged in [CController], we may use the category `system.web.CController`.
Message level should be one of the following values:

   - `trace`: this is the level used by [Yii::trace]. It is for tracing
the execution flow of the application during development.

   - `info`: this is for logging general information.
   
   - `profile`: this is for performance profile which is to be described
shortly.
   
   - `warning`: this is for warning messages.
   
   - `error`: this is for fatal error messages.

Message Routing
---------------

Messages logged using [Yii::log] or [Yii::trace] are kept in memory. We
usually need to display them in browser windows, or save them in some
persistent storage such as files, emails. This is called *message
routing*, i.e., sending messages to different destinations.

In Yii, message routing is managed by a [CLogRouter] application
component. It manages a set of the so-called *log routes*. Each log
route represents a single log destination. Messages sent along a log route
can be filtered according to their levels and categories.

To use message routing, we need to install and preload a [CLogRouter]
application component. We also need to configure its
[routes|CLogRouter::routes] property with the log routes that we want. The
following shows an example of the needed [application
configuration](/doc/guide/basics.application#config):

~~~
[php]
array(
	......
	'preload'=>array('log'),
	'components'=>array(
		......
		'log'=>array(
			'class'=>'CLogRouter',
			'routes'=>array(
				array(
					'class'=>'CFileLogRoute',
					'levels'=>'trace, info',
					'categories'=>'system.*',
				),
				array(
					'class'=>'CEmailLogRoute',
					'levels'=>'error, warning',
					'email'=>'admin@example.com',
				),
			),
		),
	),
)
~~~

In the above example, we have two log routes. The first route is
[CFileLogRoute] which saves messages in a file under the application
runtime directory. Only messages whose level is `trace` or `info` and whose
category starts with `system.` are saved. The second route is
[CEmailLogRoute] which sends messages to the specified email addresses.
Only messages whose level is `error` or `warning` are sent.

The following log routes are available in Yii:

   - [CDbLogRoute]: saves messages in a database table.
   - [CEmailLogRoute]: sends messages to specified email addresses.
   - [CFileLogRoute]: saves messages in a file under the application runtime directory.
   - [CWebLogRoute]: displays messages at the end of the current Web page.
   - [CProfileLogRoute]: displays profiling messages at the end of the current Web page.

> Info: Message routing occurs at the end of the current request cycle
when the application raises the [onEndRequest|CApplication::onEndRequest]
event. This event is always raised because by default it is registered as a
PHP [shutdown function](http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.register-shutdown-function.php).

### Message Filtering

As we mentioned, messages can be filtered according to their levels and
categories before they are sent long a log route. This is done by setting
the [levels|CLogRoute::levels] and [categories|CLogRoute::categories]
properties of the corresponding log route. Multiple levels or categories
should be concatenated by commas.

Because message categories are in the format of `xxx.yyy.zzz`, we may
treat them as a category hierarchy. In particular, we say `xxx` is the
parent of `xxx.yyy` which is the parent of `xxx.yyy.zzz`. We can then use
`xxx.*` to represent category `xxx` and all its child and grandchild
categories.

Performance Profiling
---------------------

Performance profiling is a special type of message logging. Performance
profiling can be used to measure the time needed for the specified code
blocks and find out what the performance bottleneck is.

To use performance profiling, we need to identify which code blocks need
to be profiled. We mark the beginning and the end of each code block by
inserting the following methods:

~~~
[php]
Yii::beginProfile('blockID');
...code block being profiled...
Yii::endProfile('blockID');
~~~

where `blockID` is an ID that uniquely identifies the code block.

Note, code blocks need to be nested properly. That is, a code block cannot
intersect with another. It must be either at a parallel level or be
completely enclosed by the other code block.

To show profiling result, we need to install a [CLogRouter] application
component with a [CProfileLogRoute] log route. This is the same as we do
with normal message routing. The [CProfileLogRoute] route will display the
performance results at the end of the current page.
