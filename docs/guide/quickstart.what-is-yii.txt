What is Yii
===========

Yii is a high-performance, component-based PHP framework for developing
large-scale Web applications rapidly. It enables maximum reusability in Web
programming and can significantly accelerate your Web application development
process. The name Yii (pronounced `Yee` or `[ji:]`) is an acroynym for
"**Yes It Is!**". This is often the accurate, and most concise response to
inquires from those new to Yii:


Is it fast? ... Is it secure? ... Is it professional? ... Is it right for my
next project? ... **Yes, it is!**


Requirements
------------

To run a Yii-powered Web application, you need a Web server that supports
PHP 5.1.0.

For developers who want to use Yii, understanding object-oriented
programming (OOP) is very helpful, because Yii is a pure OOP framework.

What is Yii Best for?
---------------------

Yii is a generic Web programming framework that can be used for developing
virtually any type of Web application.  Because it is light-weight and
equipped with sophisticated caching mechanisms, it is especially suited
to high-traffic applications, such as portals, forums, content
management systems (CMS), e-commerce systems, etc.

How does Yii Compare with Other Frameworks?
------------------------------------------

Like most PHP frameworks, Yii is an MVC framework.

Yii excels among PHP frameworks at being efficient, feature-rich and
clearly-documented. Yii is carefully designed from the ground up to be fit
for serious Web application development. It is neither a byproduct of some
project nor a conglomerate of third-party work. It is the result of the
authors' rich experience with Web application development and their investigation
of the most popular Web programming frameworks and applications.
