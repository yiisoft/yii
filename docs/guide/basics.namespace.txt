Path Alias and Namespace
========================

Yii uses path aliases extensively. A path alias is associated with a
directory or file path. It is specified in dot syntax, similar to that of
widely adopted namespace format:

~~~
RootAlias.path.to.target
~~~

where `RootAlias` is the alias of some existing directory. Yii predefines
two aliases: `system` and `application`. The former is the alias of the Yii
framework directory, while the latter is the alias of the application's
`protected` directory. We can call [YiiBase::setPathOfAlias()] to define
new path aliases (including root aliases).

By using [YiiBase::getPathOfAlias()], an alias can be translated to its
corresponding path. For example, `system.web.CController` would be
translated as `yii/framework/web/CController`.

Using aliases, it is very convenient to import the definition of a class.
For example, if we want to include the definition of the [CController]
class, we can call the following:

~~~
Yii::import('system.web.CController');
~~~

The [import|YiiBase::import] method differs from `include` and `require`
in that it is more efficient. The class definition being imported is
actually not included until it is referenced for the first time. Importing
the same namespace multiple times is also much faster than `include_once`
and `require_once`.

> Tip: When referring to a class defined by the Yii framework, we do not
need to import or include it. All core Yii classes are pre-imported.

We can also use the following syntax to import a whole directory so that
the class files under the directory can be automatically included when
needed.

~~~
Yii::import('system.web.*');
~~~

Besides [import|YiiBase::import], aliases are also used in many other
places to refer to classes. For example, an alias can be passed to
[Yii::createComponent()] to create an instance of the corresponding class,
even if the class file was not included previously.

Do not confuse path alias with namespace. A namespace refers to a logical
grouping of some class names so that they can be differentiated from other
class names even if their names are the same, while path alias is used to
refer to a class file or directory. Path alias does not conflict with
namespace.

> Tip: Because PHP prior to 5.3.0 does not support namespace
intrinsically, you cannot create instances of two classes who have the same
name but with different definitions. For this reason, all Yii framework
classes are prefixed with a letter 'C' (meaning 'class') so that they can
be differentiated from user-defined classes. It is recommended that the
prefix 'C' be reserved for Yii framework use only, and user-defined classes
be prefixed with other letters.
