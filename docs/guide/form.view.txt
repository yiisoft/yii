Creating Form
=============

Writing the `login` view is straightforward. We start with a `form` tag
whose action attribute should be the URL of the `login` action described
previously. We then insert labels and input fields for the attributes
declared in the `LoginForm` class. At the end we insert a submit button
which can be clicked by users to submit the form. All these can be done in
pure HTML code.

Yii provides a few helper classes to facilitate view composition. For
example, to create a text input field, we can call [CHtml::textField()]; to
create a drop-down list, call [CHtml::dropDownList()].

In the following, we use [CHtml] to create the login form. We assume that
the variable `$user` represents `LoginForm` instance.

~~~
[php]
<div class="yiiForm">
<?php echo CHtml::form(); ?>

<?php echo CHtml::errorSummary($user); ?>

<div class="simple">
<?php echo CHtml::activeLabel($user,'username'); ?>
<?php echo CHtml::activeTextField($user,'username') ?>
</div>

<div class="simple">
<?php echo CHtml::activeLabel($user,'password'); ?>
<?php echo CHtml::activePasswordField($user,'password')
?>
</div>

<div class="action">
<?php echo CHtml::activeCheckBox($user,'rememberMe'); ?>
Remember me next time<br/>
<?php echo CHtml::submitButton('Login'); ?>
</div>

</form>
</div><!-- yiiForm -->
~~~

The above code generates a more dynamic form. For example,
[CHtml::activeLabel()] generates a label associated with the specified
model attribute. If the attribute has an input error, the label's CSS class
will be changed to `error`, which changes the appearance of the label with
appropriate CSS styles. Similarly, [CHtml::activeTextField()] generates a
text input field for the specified model attribute and changes its CSS
class upon any input error. For more details about using [CHtml], see
[Using Helpers](/doc/guide/view.helper).

If we use the CSS style file `form.css` provided by the `yiic` script, the
generated form would be like the following:

![The login page](login1.png)

![The login with error page](login2.png)

<div class="revision">$Id$</div>
