Creating First Yii Application
==============================

To get an initial experience with Yii, we describe in this section how to
create our first Yii application. We will use the powerful `yiic` tool
which can be used to automate code creation for certain tasks. For convenience,
we assume that `YiiRoot` is the directory where Yii is installed, and `WebRoot`
is the document root of our Web server.

Run `yiic` on the command line as follows:

~~~
% YiiRoot/framework/yiic webapp WebRoot/testdrive
~~~

> Note: When running `yiic` on Mac OS, Linux or Unix, you may need to
> change the permission of the `yiic` file so that it is executable.
> Alternatively, you may run the tool as follows,
>
> ~~~
> % cd WebRoot/testdrive
> % php YiiRoot/framework/yiic.php webapp WebRoot/testdrive
> ~~~

This will create a skeleton Yii application under the directory
`WebRoot/testdrive`. The application has a directory structure that is
is needed by most Yii applications.

Without writing a single line of code, we can test drive our first Yii
application by accessing the following URL in a Web browser:

~~~
http://hostname/testdrive/index.php
~~~

As we can see, the application has four pages: the homepage, the about page,
the contact page and the login page. The contact page displays a contact
form that users can fill in to submit their inquiries to the webmaster,
and the login page allows users to be authenticated before accessing privileged
contents. See the following screenshots for more details.

The following diagram shows the directory structure of our application.

explanation about this structure.

Connecting to Database
----------------------

Most Web applications are backed by databases. Our test-drive application
is not an exception. To use a database, we need to tell the
application how to connect to it. This is done in the application
configuration file `WebRoot/testdrive/protected/config/main.php`, highlighted as follows,

~~~
[php]
return array(
	......
	'components'=>array(
		......
		'db'=>array(
			'connectionString'=>'sqlite:protected/data/testdrive.db',
		),
	),
	......
);
~~~

The above code instructs Yii that the application should connect to the SQLite database
`WebRoot/testdrive/protected/data/testdrive.db` when needed. Note that the SQLite database
is already included in the skeleton application that we just generated. The database
contains only a single table named `tbl_user`:

~~~
[sql]
CREATE TABLE tbl_user (
	id INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
	username VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL,
	password VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL,
	email VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL
);
~~~

If you want to try a MySQL database instead, you may use the included MySQL
schema file `WebRoot/testdrive/protected/data/schema.mysql.sql` to create the database.

> Note: To use Yii's database feature, we need to enable PHP PDO extension
and the driver-specific PDO extension. For the test-drive application, we
need to turn on both the `php_pdo` and `php_pdo_sqlite` extensions.


Implementing CRUD Operations
----------------------------

Now is the fun part. We would like to implement the CRUD (create, read,
update and delete) operations for the `User` table we just created. This is
also commonly needed in practical applications. Instead of taking trouble
to write actual code, we would use the powerful `yiic` tool again
to automatically generate the code for us. This process is also known as *scaffolding*.

Open a command line window, and execute the commands listed as follows,

~~~
% cd WebRoot/testdrive
% protected/yiic shell
Yii Interactive Tool v1.1
Please type 'help' for help. Type 'exit' to quit.
>> model User tbl_user
   generate models/User.php
   generate fixtures/tbl_user.php
   generate unit/UserTest.php

The following model classes are successfully generated:
    User

If you have a 'db' database connection, you can test these models now with:
    $model=User::model()->find();
    print_r($model);

>> crud User
   generate UserController.php
   generate UserTest.php
   mkdir D:/testdrive/protected/views/user
   generate create.php
   generate update.php
   generate index.php
   generate view.php
   generate admin.php
   generate _form.php
   generate _view.php

Crud 'user' has been successfully created. You may access it via:
http://hostname/path/to/index.php?r=user
~~~

In the above, we use the `yiic shell` command to interact with our
skeleton application. At the prompt, we execute two sub-commands: `model User tbl_user`
and `crud User`. The former generates a model class named `User` for the `tbl_user` table,
while the latter analyzes the `User` model and generates the code implementing
the corresponding CRUD operations.

> Note: You may encounter errors like "...could not find driver", even
> though the requirement checker shows you have already enabled PDO
> and the corresponding PDO driver. If this happens, you may try
> to run the `yiic` tool as follows,
>
> ~~~
> % php -c path/to/php.ini protected/yiic.php shell
> ~~~
>
> where `path/to/php.ini` represents the correct PHP ini file.

Let's enjoy our work by browsing the following URL:

~~~
http://hostname/testdrive/index.php?r=user
~~~

This will display a list of user entries in the `tbl_user` table.

Click the `Create User` button on the page. We will be brought to the login
page if we have not logged in before. After logged in, we see
an input form that allows us to add a new user entry. Complete the form and
click on the `Create` button. If there is any input error, a nice error
prompt will show up which prevents us from saving the input. Back to the
user list page, we should see the newly added user appearing in the list.

Repeat the above steps to add more users. Notice that user list page
will automatically paginate the user entries if there are too many to be
displayed in one page.

If we login as an administrator using `admin/admin`, we can view the user
admin page with the following URL:

~~~
http://hostname/testdrive/index.php?r=user/admin
~~~

This will show us the user entries in a nice tabular format. We can click on the table
header cells to sort the corresponding columns. We can click on the buttons
on each row of data to view, update or delete the corresponding row of data.
We can browse different pages. We can also filter and search to look for
the data we are interested in.

All these nice features come without requiring us to write a single line
of code!
