Creating First Yii Application
==============================

To get an initial experience with Yii, we describe in this section how to
create our first Yii application. We will use the powerful `yiic` tool
which can be used to automate code creation for certain tasks. For convenience,
we assume that `YiiRoot` is the directory where Yii is installed, and `WebRoot`
is the document root of our Web server.

Run `yiic` on the command line as follows:

~~~
% YiiRoot/framework/yiic webapp WebRoot/testdrive
~~~

> Note: When running `yiic` on Mac OS, Linux or Unix, you may need to
> change the permission of the `yiic` file so that it is executable.
> Alternatively, you may run the tool as follows,
>
> ~~~
> % cd WebRoot/testdrive
> % php YiiRoot/framework/yiic.php webapp WebRoot/testdrive
> ~~~

This will create a skeleton Yii application under the directory
`WebRoot/testdrive`. The application has a directory structure that is
is needed by most Yii applications.

Without writing a single line of code, we can test drive our first Yii
application by accessing the following URL in a Web browser:

~~~
http://hostname/testdrive/index.php
~~~

As we can see, the application has three pages: the homepage, the contact page
and the login page. The homepage shows some information about the application as
well as the user login status, the contact page displays a contact form that users
can fill in to submit their inquiries, and the login page allows users to be
authenticated before accessing privileged contents.
See the following screenshots for more details.

The following diagram shows the directory structure of our application.

explanation about this structure.

            login.php        the view for 'login' action
         system/             containing system view files

Connecting to Database
----------------------

Most Web applications are backed by databases. Our test-drive application
is not an exception. To use a database, we first need to tell the
application how to connect to it. This is done by changing the application
configuration file `WebRoot/testdrive/protected/config/main.php`, as shown
below:

~~~
[php]
return array(
	......
	'components'=>array(
		......
		'db'=>array(
			'connectionString'=>'sqlite:protected/data/source.db',
		),
	),
	......
);
~~~

In the above, we add a `db` entry to `components`, which instructs the
application to connect to the SQLite database
`WebRoot/testdrive/protected/data/source.db` when needed.

> Note: To use Yii's database feature, we need to enable PHP PDO extension
and the driver-specific PDO extension. For the test-drive application, we
would need the `php_pdo` and `php_pdo_sqlite` extensions to be turned on.

To this end, we need to prepare a SQLite database so that the above
configuration can be effective. Using some SQLite admin tool, we can create
a database with the following schema:

~~~
[sql]
CREATE TABLE User (
	id INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
	username VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL,
	password VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL,
	email VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL
);
~~~

For simplicity, we only create a single `User` table in our database. The
SQLite database file is saved as
`WebRoot/testdrive/protected/data/source.db`. Note that both the file and the
containing directory must be made writable by the Web server process, as
required by SQLite.


Implementing CRUD Operations
----------------------------

Now is the fun part. We would like to implement the CRUD (create, read,
update and delete) operations for the `User` table we just created. This is
also commonly needed in practical applications.

Instead of taking trouble to write actual code, we would use the powerful
`yiic` tool again to automatically generate the code for us. This
process is also known as *scaffolding*. Open a command line window, and execute
the commands listed as follows,

~~~
% cd WebRoot/testdrive
% protected/yiic shell
Yii Interactive Tool v1.0
Please type 'help' for help. Type 'exit' to quit.
>> model User
   generate User.php

The 'User' class has been successfully created in the following file:
    D:\wwwroot\testdrive\protected\models\User.php

If you have a 'db' database connection, you can test it now with:
    $model=User::model()->find();
    print_r($model);

>> crud User
   generate UserController.php
   generate create.php
      mkdir D:/wwwroot/testdrive/protected/views/user
   generate update.php
   generate list.php
   generate show.php

Crud 'user' has been successfully created. You may access it via:
http://hostname/path/to/index.php?r=user
~~~

In the above, we use the `yiic shell` command to interact with our
skeleton application. At the prompt, we execute two sub-commands: `model User`
and `crud User`. The former generates a model class for the `User` table,
while the latter reads the `User` model and generates the code needed
the CRUD operations.

> Note: You may encounter errors like "...could not find driver", even
> though the requirement checker shows you have already enabled PDO
> and the corresponding PDO driver. If this happens, you may try
> to run the `yiic` tool as follows,
>
> ~~~
> % php -c path/to/php.ini protected/yiic.php shell
> ~~~
>
> where `path/to/php.ini` represents the correct PHP ini file.

Let's enjoy our work by browsing the following URL:

~~~
http://hostname/testdrive/index.php?r=user
~~~

This will display a list of user entries in the `User` table. Since our
table is empty, nothing will appear at the moment.

Click the `New User` link on the page. We will be brought to the login
page if we have not logged in before. After logged in, we are shown with
an input form that allows us to add a new user entry. Complete the form and
click on the `Create` button. If there is any input error, a nice error
prompt will be shown which prevents us from saving the input. Back to the
user list, we should see the newly added user appearing in the list.

Repeat the above steps to add more users. Notice that user list page
will automatically paginate the user entries if there are too many to be
displayed in one page.

If we login as an administrator using `admin/admin`, we can view the user
admin page with the following URL:

~~~
http://hostname/testdrive/index.php?r=user/admin
~~~

This will show us a nice table of user entries. We can click on the table
header cells to sort the corresponding columns. And like the user list page,
the admin page also performs pagination when there are too many user entries
to be displayed in one page.

All these nice features come without requiring us to write a single line
of code!
