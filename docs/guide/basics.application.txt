Application
===========

Application represents the execution context of request processing. Its
main task is to resolve the user request and dispatch it to an appropriate
controller for further processing. It also serves as the central place for
keeping application-level configurations.

Application is implemented as singleton. It is created in the entry
script, as we have already seen. The application singleton can be accessed
anywhere via [Yii::app()|YiiBase::app]. For this reason, application may be
considered as the common part shared by all controllers.

Application Configuration
-------------------------

By default, application is an instance of [CWebApplication]. To customize
it, we normally provide a configuration file (or array) to configure its
property initial values when the application instance is being created. We
can also extend [CWebApplication], but it is less convenient.

The configuration is an array of key-value pairs. Each key represents the
name of a property of the application instance, and each value the
corresponding property's initial value. For example, the following
configuration configures the [name|CApplication::name] and
[defaultController|CWebApplication::defaultController] properties of the
application.

~~~
[php]
array(
	'name'=>'Yii Framework',
	'defaultController'=>'site',
)
~~~

We usually store the configuration in a separate PHP script (e.g.
`protected/config/main.php`). Inside the script, we return the
configuration array as follows,

~~~
[php]
return array(...);
~~~

To apply the configuration, we pass it as a parameter to the application's
constructor, or to [Yii::createWebApplication()] like the following, which
is usually done in the [entry script](/doc/guide/basics.entry):

~~~
[php]
$app=Yii::createWebApplication($configFile);
~~~

> Tip: If the application configuration is very complex, we can split it
into several files, each returning a portion of the configuration array.
Then, in a master configuration file, we call PHP `include()` to include
the rest configuration files and merge them into a complete configuration
array.

Application Base Directory
--------------------------

Application base directory refers to the root directory that contains all
security-sensitive PHP scripts and data. By default, it is a subdirectory
named `protected` that is located under the directory containing the entry
script. It can be customized via setting the
[basePath|CWebApplication::basePath] property in the application
configuration.

Contents under the application base directory should be protected from
being accessed by Web users. With [Apache HTTP
server](http://httpd.apache.org/), this can be done easily by placing a
`.htaccess` file under the base directory. The content of the `.htaccess`
file is as follows,

~~~
[php]
deny from all
~~~

Application Component
---------------------

Functionalities of application can be easily customized and enriched with
its flexible component architecture. Application manages a set of
application components, each of which implements features in some aspect.
For example, a [CMemCache] component may be plugged into the application so
that caching via memcache is available anywhere in the code. As a matter of
fact, application resolves the user request with the help of [CUrlManager]
and [CHttpRequest] components.

Properties of application components can also be configured. This is done
by configuring the [components|CApplication::components] property of
application. For example, we can configure [CMemCache] component so that it
can use multiple memcache servers for caching,

~~~
[php]
array(
	......
	'components'=>array(
		......
		'cache'=>array(
			'class'=>'CMemCache',
			'servers'=>array(
				array('host'=>'server1', 'port'=>11211, 'weight'=>60),
				array('host'=>'server2', 'port'=>11211, 'weight'=>40),
			),
		),
	),
)
~~~

In the above, we add the `cache` element to the `components` array. The
`cache` element states that the class of the component is
`system.caching.CMemCache` and its `servers` property should be initialized
as such.

To access an application component, use `Yii::app()->ComponentID`, where
`ComponentID` refers to the ID of the component (e.g. `Yii::app()->cache`).

> Tip: Application components are created on demand. Therefore,
performance is not affected even if we have many components plugged in. In
case a component needs to be created beforehand, we can add its ID to the
[preload|CApplication::preload] property of the application.

Core Application Components
---------------------------

Yii predefines a set of core application components to provide features
common among Web applications. For example, the
[request|CWebApplication::request] component is used to resolve user
requests and provide information such as URL, cookies. By configuring the
properties of these core components, we can change the default behaviors of
Yii in nearly every aspect.

Below we list the core components that are pre-declared by
[CWebApplication].

   - [db|CApplication::db]: [CDbConnection] - provides the database
connection. Note, you must configure its
[connectionString|CDbConnection::connectionString] property.

   - [errorHandler|CApplication::errorHandler]: [CErrorHandler] - handles
uncaught PHP errors and exceptions.

   - [securityManager|CApplication::securityManager]: [CSecurityManager] -
provides security-related services, such as hashing, encryption.

   - [statePersister|CApplication::statePersister]: [CStatePersister] -
provides global state persistence method.

   - [coreMessages|CApplication::coreMessages]: [CPhpMessageSource] -
provides translated core messages used by Yii framework.

   - [messages|CApplication::messages]: [CPhpMessageSource] - provides
translated messaged used by Yii application.

   - [urlManager|CWebApplication::urlManager]: [CUrlManager] - provides
URL parsing and creation functionality.

   - [request|CWebApplication::request]: [CHttpRequest] - provides
information related with user requests.

   - [session|CWebApplication::session]: [CHttpSession] - provides the
session-related functionalities.

   - [assetManager|CWebApplication::assetManager]: [CAssetManager] -
manages the publishing of private asset files.

Besides the above compoennts, a component named
[cache|CApplication::cache] is also declared but without specifying its
class. The [cache|CApplication::cache] component is used by Yii for data
caching purpose. When it is enabled by specifying an actual class (e.g.
[CMemCache], [CDbCache]), Yii will automatically cache some data that would
otherwise take long time to generate. 

Application Lifecycles
----------------------

When handling a user request, the application will undergo the following
lifecycles:

   1. load application configuration;
   1. initialize application with [CApplication::init()]	
	   - set up class autoloader and error handling;
	   - load static application components;
   1. raise [onBeginRequest|CApplication::onBeginRequest] event;
   1. process the user request:
	   - resolve the user request;
	   - create controller;
	   - run controller;
   1. raise [onEndRequest|CApplication::onEndRequest] event;
