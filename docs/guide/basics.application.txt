Application
===========

Application represents the execution context of request processing. Its
main task is to resolve the user request and dispatch it to an appropriate
controller for further processing. It also serves as the central place for
keeping application-level configurations. For this reason, application is
also called `front-controller`.

Application is created as a singleton by the [entry script](/doc/guide/basics.entry).
The application singleton can be accessed at any place via [Yii::app()|YiiBase::app].


Application Configuration
-------------------------

By default, application is an instance of [CWebApplication]. To customize
it, we normally provide a configuration file (or array) to initialize its
property values when the application instance is being created. An alternative
way of customizing application is to extend [CWebApplication].

The configuration is an array of key-value pairs. Each key represents the
name of a property of the application instance, and each value the
corresponding property's initial value. For example, the following
configuration configures the [name|CApplication::name] and
[defaultController|CWebApplication::defaultController] properties of the
application.

~~~
[php]
array(
	'name'=>'Yii Framework',
	'defaultController'=>'site',
)
~~~

We usually store the configuration in a separate PHP script (e.g.
`protected/config/main.php`). Inside the script, we return the
configuration array as follows,

~~~
[php]
return array(...);
~~~

To apply the configuration, we pass the configuration file name as
a parameter to the application's constructor, or to [Yii::createWebApplication()]
like the following, which is usually done in the [entry script](/doc/guide/basics.entry):

~~~
[php]
$app=Yii::createWebApplication($configFile);
~~~

> Tip: If the application configuration is very complex, we can split it
into several files, each returning a portion of the configuration array.
Then, in the main configuration file, we call PHP `include()` to include
the rest configuration files and merge them into a complete configuration
array.


Application Base Directory
--------------------------

Application base directory refers to the root directory that contains all
security-sensitive PHP scripts and data. By default, it is a subdirectory
named `protected` that is located under the directory containing the entry
script. It can be customized via setting the
[basePath|CWebApplication::basePath] property in the [application configuration](/doc/guide/basics.application#application-configuration).

Contents under the application base directory should be protected from
being accessed by Web users. With [Apache HTTP
server](http://httpd.apache.org/), this can be done easily by placing a
`.htaccess` file under the base directory. The content of the `.htaccess`
file is as follows,

~~~
deny from all
~~~

Application Component
---------------------

Functionalities of application can be easily customized and enriched with
its flexible component architecture. Application manages a set of
application components, each implementing specific features.
For example, application resolves a user request with the help of [CUrlManager]
and [CHttpRequest] components.

By configuring the [components|CApplication::components] property of
application, we can customize the class and property values of any
application component used in an application. For example, we can
configure [CMemCache] component so that it can use multiple memcache
servers for caching,

~~~
[php]
array(
	......
	'components'=>array(
		......
		'cache'=>array(
			'class'=>'CMemCache',
			'servers'=>array(
				array('host'=>'server1', 'port'=>11211, 'weight'=>60),
				array('host'=>'server2', 'port'=>11211, 'weight'=>40),
			),
		),
	),
)
~~~

In the above, we add the `cache` element to the `components` array. The
`cache` element states that the class of the component is
`CMemCache` and its `servers` property should be initialized as such.

To access an application component, use `Yii::app()->ComponentID`, where
`ComponentID` refers to the ID of the component (e.g. `Yii::app()->cache`).

An application component may be disabled by setting `enabled` to be false
in its configuration. Null is returned when we access a disabled component.

> Tip: By default, application components are created on demand. This means
an application component may not be created at all if it is not accessed
during a user request. As a result, the overall performance may not be
degraded even if an application is configured with many components. Some
application components (e.g. [CLogRouter]) may need to be created no matter
they are accessed or not. To do so, list their IDs in the [preload|CApplication::preload]
property of the application.

Core Application Components
---------------------------

Yii predefines a set of core application components to provide features
common among Web applications. For example, the
[request|CWebApplication::request] component is used to resolve user
requests and provide information such as URL, cookies. By configuring the
properties of these core components, we can change the default behaviors of
Yii in nearly every aspect.

Below we list the core components that are pre-declared by
[CWebApplication].

   - [assetManager|CWebApplication::assetManager]: [CAssetManager] -
manages the publishing of private asset files.

   - [authManager|CWebApplication::authManager]: [CAuthManager] - manages role-based access control (RBAC).

   - [cache|CApplication::cache]: [CCache] - provides data caching
functionality. Note, you must specify the actual class (e.g.
[CMemCache], [CDbCache]). Otherwise, null will be returned when you
access this component.

   - [clientScript|CWebApplication::clientScript]: [CClientScript] -
manages client scripts (javascripts and CSS).

   - [coreMessages|CApplication::coreMessages]: [CPhpMessageSource] -
provides translated core messages used by Yii framework.

   - [db|CApplication::db]: [CDbConnection] - provides the database
connection. Note, you must configure its
[connectionString|CDbConnection::connectionString] property in order
to use this component.

   - [errorHandler|CApplication::errorHandler]: [CErrorHandler] - handles
uncaught PHP errors and exceptions.

   - [format|CApplication::format]: [CFormatter] - formats data values
for display purpose. This has been available since version 1.1.0.

   - [messages|CApplication::messages]: [CPhpMessageSource] - provides
translated messages used by Yii application.

   - [request|CWebApplication::request]: [CHttpRequest] - provides
information related with user requests.

   - [securityManager|CApplication::securityManager]: [CSecurityManager] -
provides security-related services, such as hashing, encryption.

   - [session|CWebApplication::session]: [CHttpSession] - provides
session-related functionalities.

   - [statePersister|CApplication::statePersister]: [CStatePersister] -
provides global state persistence method.

   - [urlManager|CWebApplication::urlManager]: [CUrlManager] - provides
URL parsing and creation functionality.

   - [user|CWebApplication::user]: [CWebUser] - represents the identity
information of the current user.

   - [themeManager|CWebApplication::themeManager]: [CThemeManager] - manages themes.


Application Lifecycles
----------------------

When handling a user request, an application will undergo the following
lifecycles:

   0. Pre-initializes the application with [CApplication::preinit()];

   1. Set up class autoloader and error handling;

   2. Register core application components;

   3. Load application configuration;

   4. Initialize the application with [CApplication::init()]
       - Register application behaviors;
	   - Load static application components;

   5. Raise [onBeginRequest|CApplication::onBeginRequest] event;

   6. Process the user request:
	   - Resolve the user request;
	   - Create controller;
	   - Run controller;

   7. Raise [onEndRequest|CApplication::onEndRequest] event;
