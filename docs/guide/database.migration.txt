Database Migration
==================

> Note: The database migration feature has been available since version 1.1.6.

Like source code, the structure of a database is evolving as we develop and maintain a database-driven application. For example, during development, we may want to add a new table; or after the application is put into production, we may realize the need of adding an index on a column. It is important to keep track of these structural database changes (called **migration**) like we do with our source code. If the source code and the database are out of sync, it is very likely the whole system may break. For this reason, Yii provides a database migration tool that can keep track of database migration history, apply new migrations, or remove existing ones.

The following steps how we can use database migration during development:

1. Tim creates a new migration (e.g. create a new table)
2. Tim commits the new migration into source control system (e.g. SVN, GIT)
3. Doug updates from source control system and receives the new migration
4. Doug applies the migration to his local development database


Yii supports database migration via the `yiic migrate` command line tool. This tool supports creating new migrations, applying/removing/redoing migrations, and showing migration history and new migrations.

In the following, we will describe how to use this tool.


Creating Migrations
-------------------

To create a new migration (e.g. create a news table), we run the following command:

~~~
yiic migrate create --name=create_news_table
~~~

The `name` parameter should be a very brief description of the migration. If not present, the parameter will take the value `untitled`. As we will show in the following, the `name` parameter is used as part of a PHP class name, it should only contain letters, digits or underscore characters.

The above command will create under the `protected/migrations` directory a new file named `m20101129185401_create_news_table.php` which contains the following initial code:

~~~
[php]
class m20101129185401_create_news_table extends CDbMigration
{
	public function up()
	{
	}

    /*
    public function down()
    {
    }
    */
}
~~~

Notice that the class name is the same as the file name which is of the pattern `m<timestamp>_<name>`, where `<timestamp>` refers to the UTC timestamp when the migration is created while `<name>` is taken from the command's `name` parameter.

The `up()` method should contain the code implementing the actual database migration, while the `down()` method may contain the code removing what is done in `up()`.

Sometimes, it is impossible to implement `down()`. For example, if we delete table rows in `up()`, we will not be able to recover them in `down()`. In this case, the migration is called irreversible, meaning we cannot roll back to a previous state of the database.

As an example, let's show the migration about creating a news table.

~~~
[php]
class m20101129185401_create_news_table extends CDbMigration
{
	public function up()
	{
		$this->createTable('tbl_news', array(
			'id' => 'pk',
			'title' => 'string NOT NULL',
			'content' => 'text',
		));
	}

	public function down()
	{
		$this->dropTable('tbl_news');
	}
}
~~~

The base class [CDbMigration] provides a set of methods for manipulating data and schema of a database. For example, [CDbMigration::createTable] will create a database table, while [CDbMigration::insert] will insert a row of data. These methods all use the database connection returned by [CDbMigration::getDbConnection()], which by default returns `Yii::app()->db`.

> Info: You may notice that the database methods provided by [CDbMigration] are very similar to those in [CDbCommand]. Indeed they are nearly the same except that [CDbMigration] methods will measure the time used by their methods and print some messages about the method parameters.


Applying Migrations
-------------------

To apply all available new migrations (i.e., make the local database up-to-date), run the following command:

~~~
yiic migrate
~~~

The command will show the list of all new migrations. If you confirm to apply the migrations, it will run the `up()` method in every new migration class, one after another, in the order of the timestamp value in the class name.

After applying a migration, the migration tool will keep a record in a database table named `tbl_migration`. This allows the tool to identify which migrations have been applied and which are not. If the `tbl_migration` table does not exist, the tool will automatically create it in the database specified by the `db` application component.

To migrate the database to a specific version, we can use the following following command:

~~~
yiic migrate --version=20101129185401
~~~

That is, we use the `version` parameter to specify the timestamp of the migration that we want to migrate the database to. If there are multiple migrations between the last applied migration and the specified migration, all these migrations will be applied. If the specified migration has been applied before, then all migrations applied after it will be removed.

Sometimes, we may only want to apply one or a few new migrations. We can use the following command:

~~~
yiic migrate up --step=3
~~~

This command will apply the next 3 new migrations. Changing the parameter `step` will allow us to change the number of migrations to be applied. If the parameter is not specified, it will take the default value 1, meaning one migration at a time.


Removing Migrations
-------------------

To remove the last one or several applied migrations, we can use the following command:

~~~
yiic migrate down --step=3
~~~

This command will call the `down()` method of the last 3 applied migrations.   Changing the parameter `step` will allow us to change the number of migrations to be removed. If the parameter is not specified, it will take the default value 1, meaning removing one migration at a time.

It is also possible to remove migrations down to a specific version, as shown in the previous sub-section:

~~~
yiic migrate --version=20101129185401
~~~

As we described before, not all migrations can be removed. Trying to remove such migrations will throw an exception and stop the whole removing process.


Redoing Migrations
------------------

Redoing migrations means first removing and then applying the specified migrations. This can be done with the following command:

~~~
yiic migrate redo --step=3
~~~


Showing Migration Information
-----------------------------

Besides applying and removing migrations, the migration tool can also display the migration history and the new migrations to be applied.

~~~
yiic migrate history --limit=10
yiic migrate list
~~~

The first command shows the last 10 migrations that have been applied and when they are applied. And the second command shows the full list of the new migrations that have not been applied.


Customizing Migration Tool
--------------------------

The migration tool can be customized in several aspects. To do so, we have to modify the console application's configuration file by adding the following:

~~~
[php]
return array(
	......
	'commandMap'=>array(
		'migrate'=>array(
			'class'=>'system.cli.commands.MigrateCommand',
			'migrationPath'=>'path/to/migrations',
			'migrationTable'=>'migration_table_name',
			'connectionID'=>'db_app_id',
			'templateFile'=>'path/to/template',
		),
		......
	),
	......
);
~~~

The above code allows us to configure several properties of the migration tool:

* `migrationPath`: string, specifies the directory storing all migration class files. If not specified, it will use the `migrations` sub-directory under the application base path.

* `migrationTable`: string, specifies the name of the database table for storing migration history information. It defaults to `tbl_migration`. The table structure is `version varchar(255) primary key, apply_time integer`.

* `connectionID`: string, specifies the ID of the database application component. Defaults to 'db'.

* `templateFile`: string, specifies the path of the file to be served as the code template for generating the migration classes. If not set, an internal template will be used. In the template, the token `{ClassName}` will be replaced with the actual migration class name.
