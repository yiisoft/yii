Installation
============

Installation of Yee mainly involves the following two steps:

   1. Download Yee Framework from [yeeframework.com](http://www.yeeframework.com/).
   2. Unpack the Yee release file to a Web-accessible directory.

> Tip: Yee does not need to be installed under a Web-accessible directory.
A Yee application has one entry script which is usually the only file that
needs to be exposed to Web users. Other PHP scripts, including those from
Yee, should be protected from Web access; otherwise they might be exploited 
by hackers.

Requirements
------------

After installing Yee, you may want to verify that your server satisfies
Yee's requirements. You can do so by accessing the requirement checker 
script via the following URL in a Web browser:

~~~
http://hostname/path/to/yee/requirements/index.php
~~~

Yee requires PHP 5.1, so the server must have PHP 5.1 or above installed and 
available to the web server.  Yee has been tested with [Apache HTTP server](http://httpd.apache.org/) 
on Windows and Linux.  It may also run on other Web servers and platforms, 
provided PHP 5.1 is supported.
