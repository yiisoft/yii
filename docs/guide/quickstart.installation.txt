Installation
============

Manual installation
-------------------

Installation of Yii mainly involves the following two steps:

   1. Download Yii Framework from [yiiframework.com](http://www.yiiframework.com/).
   2. Unpack the Yii release file to a Web-accessible directory.

Git installation ([submodules](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Submodules) method)
------------------------------------
Using a Git submodule to install Yii has several advantages.  It allows you
to easily update Yii framework for your project in the future. And it also
allows you to more easily send back patches / bug fixes in the future.

   - Use the following commands at a command line (with Git installed):

   ~~~
   [php]
   cd web-accessible-directory
   git init
   git submodule add git://github.com/yiisoft/yii.git yii
   ./yii/framework/yiic webapp ./
   ~~~

   - To update to the latest Yii framework in the future, run these commands:

   ~~~
   [php]
   cd web-accessible-directory/yii
   git pull origin master
   ~~~

> Tip: Yii does not need to be installed under a Web-accessible directory.
A Yii application has one entry script which is usually the only file that
needs to be exposed to Web users. Other PHP scripts, including those from
Yii, should be protected from Web access; otherwise they might be exploited 
by hackers.

Requirements
------------

After installing Yii, you may want to verify that your server satisfies
Yii's requirements. You can do so by accessing the requirement checker 
script via the following URL in a Web browser:

~~~
http://hostname/path/to/yii/requirements/index.php
~~~

Yii requires PHP 5.1, so the server must have PHP 5.1 or above installed and 
available to the web server.  Yii has been tested with [Apache HTTP server](http://httpd.apache.org/) 
on Windows and Linux.  It may also run on other Web servers and platforms, 
provided PHP 5.1 is supported.
