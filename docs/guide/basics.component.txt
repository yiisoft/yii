Component
=========

Yii framework and applications are built upon components which are objects
written to a specification. In Yii, a component is an instance of
[CComponent] or its derived class. Using an Yii component mainly involves
configuring its properties and raising/handling its events. The base class
[CComponent] specifies how to define properties and events.

Component Property
------------------

A component property is like an object's public member variable. We can
read its value or assign a value to it. For example,

~~~
[php]
$width=$component->textWidth;     // get the textWidth property
$component->enableCaching=true;   // set the enableCaching property
~~~

To define a component property, we can simply declare a public member
variable in the component class. A more flexible way, however, is by
defining getter and setter methods like the following:

~~~
[php]
public function getTextWidth( )      { return $this->_textWidth; }
public function setTextWidth($value) { $this->_width=$value;     }
~~~

The above code defines a writable property named `textWidth` (the name is
case-insensitive). When reading the property, `getTextWidth()` is  invoked
and its returned value becomes the property value; Similarly, when writing
the property, `setTextWidth()` is invoked. If the setter method is not
defined, the property would be read-only and writing it would throw an
exception. Using getter and setter methods to define a property has the
benefit that additional logic (e.g. performing validation, raising events)
can be executed when reading and writing the property.

Component Event
---------------

Component events are special properties that take methods (called event
handlers) as their values. Attaching (assigning) a method to an event will
cause the method to be invoked automatically at the places where the event
is raised. Therefore, the behavior of a component can be modified in a way
that may not be foreseen during the development of the component.

A component event is defined by declaring a method whose name starts with
`on`. Like property names defined via getter/setter, event names are
case-insensitive. The following code defines an `onClicked` event:

~~~
[php]
public function onClicked($event)
{
	$this->raiseEvent('onClicked', $event);
}
~~~

where `$event` is an instance of [CEvent] or its child class representing
the event parameter.

We can now attach a method to this event:

~~~
[php]
$component->onClicked=$callback;
~~~

where `$callback` refers to a valid PHP callback. It can be a global
function or a class method. If the latter, the callback must be given as an
array: `array($object,'methodName')`.

The signature of an event handler must be as follows:

~~~
[php]
function methodName($event) { ...... }
~~~

where `$event` is the parameter describing the event (it originates from
`raiseEvent()` call). The `$event` parameter is an instance of [CEvent] or
its derived class. At the minimum, it contains the information about who
raises the event.

If we call `onClicked()` now, the `onClicked` event will be raised (inside
`onClicked()`), and the attached event handler will be invoked
automatically.

An event can be attached with multiple handlers by repeating the
assignments. When the event is raised, the handlers will be invoked in the
order that they are attached to the event. If a handler decides to prevent
the rest handlers from being invoked, it can set
[$event->handled|CEvent::handled] to true.
