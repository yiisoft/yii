Managing Comments
=================

Comment management includes updating, deleting and approving comments. These operations are implemented as actions in the `CommentController` class.


Updating and Deleting Comments
------------------------------

The code generated by `yiic` for updating and deleting comments remains largely unchanged. Because we support comment preview when updating a comment, we only need to change the `actionUpdate()` method of `CommentController` as follows,

~~~
[php]
public function actionUpdate()
{
	$comment=$this->loadComment();

	if(isset($_POST['Comment']))
	{
		$comment->attributes=$_POST['Comment'];
		if(isset($_POST['previewComment']))
			$comment->validate();
		else if(isset($_POST['submitComment']) && $comment->save())
			$this->redirect(array('post/show',
				'id'=>$comment->postId,
				'#'=>'c'.$comment->id));
	}

	$this->render('update',array('comment'=>$comment));
}
~~~

It is very similar to that in `PostController`.


Approving Comments
------------------

When comments are newly created, they are in pending approval status and need to be approved in order to be visible to guest users. Approving a comment is mainly about changing the status column of the comment.

We create an `actionApprove()` method in `CommentController` as follows,

~~~
[php]
public function actionApprove()
{
	if(Yii::app()->request->isPostRequest)
	{
		$comment=$this->loadComment();
		$comment->approve();
		$this->redirect(array('post/show',
			'id'=>$comment->postId,
			'#'=>'c'.$comment->id));
	}
	else
		throw new CHttpException(400,'Invalid request...');
}
~~~

In the above, when the `approve` action is invoked via a POST request, we call the `approve()` method defined in the `Comment` model to change the status. We then redirect the user browser to the page displaying the post that this comment belongs to.

We also modify the `actionList()` method of `Comment` to show a list of comments pending approval.

~~~
[php]
public function actionList()
{
	$criteria=new CDbCriteria;
	$criteria->condition='Comment.status='.Comment::STATUS_PENDING;

	$pages=new CPagination(Comment::model()->count($criteria));
	$pages->pageSize=self::PAGE_SIZE;
	$pages->applyLimit($criteria);

	$comments=Comment::model()->with('post')->findAll($criteria);

	$this->render('list',array(
		'comments'=>$comments,
		'pages'=>$pages,
	));
}
~~~

In the `list` view, we display the detail of every comment that is pending approval. In particular, we show an `approve` link button as follows,

~~~
[php]
<?php if($comment->status==Comment::STATUS_PENDING): ?>
	<span class="pending">Pending approval</span> |
	<?php echo CHtml::linkButton('Approve', array(
	    'submit'=>array('comment/approve','id'=>$comment->id),
	)); ?> |
<?php endif; ?>
~~~

We use [CHtml::linkButton()] instead of [CHtml::link()] because the former would trigger a POST request while the latter a GET request. It is recommended that a GET request should not alter the data on the server. Otherwise, we face the danger that a user may inadvertently change the server-side data several times if he refreshes the page.
