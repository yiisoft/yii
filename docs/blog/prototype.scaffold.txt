Scaffolding
===========

Create, read, update and delete (CRUD) are the four basic operations of persistent storage. In our blog application, the major task is to implement the CRUD operations for both posts and comments. In this section, we will use the `yiic` tool to accomplish this task. This process is also known as *scaffolding*.

Open a command window and run the following commands:

~~~
% /wwwroot/yii/framework/yiic shell /wwwroot/blog/index.php
Yii Interactive Tool v1.0
Please type 'help' for help. Type 'exit' to quit.
>> model User
......
>> model Post
......
>> model Tag
......
>> model Comment
......
>> crud Post
......
>> crud Comment
......
>> exit
~~~

> Info: Some PHP installations may use a different `php.ini` file for command line (CLI) PHP parser. As a result, when running the above `yiic` commands, you may encounter errors like "YiiBase::include(PDO.php): failed to open stream..." or "...could not find driver". Please double check your CLI PHP configuration by executing the following command:
>
> ~~~
> php -r "phpinfo();"
> ~~~
>
> The result of the above command will show which `php.ini` file is being used and which extensions are loaded. If a wrong `php.ini` file is used, you may use the following command to explicitly specify the correct `php.ini` to use:
>
> ~~~
> php -c php.ini /wwwroot/yii/framework/yiic.php shell /wwwroot/blog/index.php
> ~~~

The commands above accomplish two tasks. First, the `model` commands generate a [model](http://www.yiiframework.com/doc/guide/basics.model) class file for each database table. Second, the `crud` commands generate the code needed by the CRUD operations for the `Post` and `Comment` models.

We can test the generated code by accessing the following URLs:

~~~
http://www.example.com/blog/index.php?r=post
http://www.example.com/blog/index.php?r=comment
~~~

Notice that the post and comment features implemented by the generated code are completely independent of each other. Also, when creating a new post or comment, we are required to enter information, such as `authId` and `createTime`, which in real application should be set by the program. Don't worry. We will fix these problems in the next milestones. For now, we should be fairly satisfied as this prototype already contains most features that we need to implement for the blog application.

To prepare for the next milestones, let's take a closer look at the files generated by the above commands. All the files are generated under `/wwwroot/blog/protected`. For convenience, we group them into [model](http://www.yiiframework.com/doc/guide/basics.model) files, [controller](http://www.yiiframework.com/doc/guide/basics.controller) files and [view](http://www.yiiframework.com/doc/guide/basics.view) files:

 - model files:
	 * `models/User.php` contains the `user` class that extends from [CActiveRecord] and can be used to access the `User` database table;
	 * `models/Post.php` contains the `Post` class that extends from [CActiveRecord] and can be used to access the `Post` database table;
	 * `models/Tag.php` contains the `Tag` class that extends from [CActiveRecord] and can be used to access the `Tag` database table;
	 * `models/Comment.php` contains the `Comment` class that extends from [CActiveRecord] and can be used to access the `Comment` database table;

 - controller file:
	 * `controllers/PostController.php` contains the `PostController` class which is the controller in charge of all CRUD operations about posts;
	 * `controllers/CommentController.php` contains the `CommentController` class which is the controller in charge of all CRUD operations about comments;

 - view files:
	 * `views/post/create.php` is the view file that shows an HTML form to create a new post;
	 * `views/post/update.php` is the view file that shows an HTML form to update an existing post;
	 * `views/post/show.php` is the view file that displays the detailed information of a post;
	 * `views/post/list.php` is the view file that displays a list of posts;
	 * `views/post/admin.php` is the view file that displays posts in a table with administrative commands.
	 * `views/post/_form.php` is the partial view file that displays the HTML form for collecting post information. It is embedded in the `create` and `update` views.
	 * a similar set of view files are also generated for comment.

In order to understand better how the above files are used, we show in the following the workflow that occurs in the blog application when displaying a list of posts:

 1. The [entry script](http://www.yiiframework.com/doc/guide/basics.entry) is executed by the Web server which creates and initializes an [application](http://www.yiiframework.com/doc/guide/basics.application) instance to handle the request;
 2. The application creates an instance of `PostController` and executes it;
 3. The `PostController` instance executes the requested `list` action by calling its `actionList()` method;
 4. The `actionList()` method queries database to bring back the list of recent posts;
 5. The `actionList()` method renders the `list` view with the post data.
