         Upgrading Instructions for Yii Framework v1.1.11
         ===============================================

!!!IMPORTANT!!!

The following upgrading instructions are cumulative. That is,
if you want to upgrade from version A to version C and there is
version B between A and C, you need to following the instructions
for both A and B.

General upgrade intructions
---------------------------
- Make a backup.
- Clean up your 'assets' folder.
- Replace 'framework' dir with the new one or point SVN to a fresh
  release and update.
- Check if everything is OK, if not — revert from backup and post
  issues to Yii issue tracker.


Upgrading from v1.1.10
----------------------

Upgrading from v1.1.9
---------------------
- Previously xSendFile() was returning false if the file was not found.
This has been removed to allow relative file paths. If you are relying on this check,
you will need to do it manually before calling xSendFile().

Upgrading from v1.1.8
---------------------
- CConfiguration::createObject, CController::paginate and CHtml::getActiveId deprecated since 1.0.x were removed. Use
  Yii::createComponent, new CPagination directly and CHtml::activeId respectively.

- In CErrorHandler::handleException() the checking for ajax call has been removed
as it was preventing to customize the display of the exception during an ajax call.

- Previously in case of validation error the CSS "error" class was not added to the row container at all when
checkBoxList or radioButtonList where used. This is fixed now and proper "error" CSS class is added to the row
container but in case of validation error, all labels from the list are shown in red because of the CSS rule.

To fix this and display only the attribute label in red:

in <projectdir>/css/form.css the line:

     div.form div.error label

should be changed to

     div.form div.error label:first-child

- If you've used "through" ActiveRecord option in your relation definitions it's good to update code as shown below.
Old style of defining this option still works but is now deprecated.

Change

~~~
class Group extends CActiveRecord
{
    public function relations()
    {
  		return array(
  			'roles'=>array(self::HAS_MANY,'Role','group_id'),
  			'users'=>array(self::HAS_MANY,'User','user_id','through'=>'roles'),
  		);
  	}
}
~~~

to

~~~
class Group extends CActiveRecord
{
    public function relations()
  	{
  		return array(
  			'roles'=>array(self::HAS_MANY,'Role','group_id'),
  			'users'=>array(self::HAS_MANY,'User',array('user_id'=>'id'),'through'=>'roles'),
  		);
  	}
}
~~~


Upgrading from v1.1.7
---------------------
- CDbAuthManager will now quote columns and tables referenced in its SQL code.
If your auth tables were created in a case-insensitive fashion (e.g. on PostgreSQL)
while your DBMS is case-sensitive, this change may cause DB query errors.
To fix this issue, you will have to rename the table names and columns, or re-create
the auth tables by following the SQL code given in framework/web/auth/*.sql.
- jQuery was upgraded to 1.6.1. Check your client side code and if you have issues consider
downgrading to 1.5.1 or 1.4.4.


Upgrading from v1.1.6
---------------------
- Make sure you are using latest stable PHPUnit 3.5 if you are using unit tests.


Upgrading from v1.1.5
---------------------
- In CActiveRecord::relations(), if a relation involves composite foreign keys, the foreign key
  columns must be separated by commas now. Previously, the columns can be separated by either
  commas or spaces. If your mode code are generated by Gii or yiic shell, you do not need to
  worry about this.
- CLDR data was updated to a newest available version so data formats, month
  names and other regional data can be changed.


Upgrading from v1.1.4
---------------------
- CHtml will no longer render null attributes for HTML tags. This means if $htmlOptions is
  array('class'=>null), it will no longer render the 'class' attribute in the HTML tag.
  it would render the class attribute as class="". We expect this will not cause much trouble
  in upgrading. However, in case problems happen, you may set the attribute to be an empty string
  to solve them.

- Now by default CWebLogRoute does not render logs in FireBug for ajax calls.
  To get logs rendered for ajax calls in FireBug set CWebLogRoute::ignoreAjaxInFireBug to false

- The implementation of CCache::flush() was changed a little. Child classes should now implement
  a flushValues() method. If you use any custom cache class with flush functionality, you should
  rename the flush method accordingly.

- The prompt and empty options used in CHtml methods will NOT be HTML-encoded anymore. It will now
  always convert ">" and "<" into "&gt;" and "lt;", respectively. This should be sufficient in most
  cases. But if your application uses some other special characters, or if you allow user inputs
  to be used as prompt and empty text labels, please call CHtml::encode() explicitly on these option
  values.


Upgrading from v1.1.3
---------------------
- Zii was merged into Yii so if you are using SVN to keep framework
  up to date, you'll need to delete 'framework/zii' and then update it.

Upgrading from v1.1.2
---------------------
- When using the skin feature, you now need to explicitly configure
the 'enableSkin' property of 'widgetFactory' application component
to be true. Also, if you have configured the 'widgets' property, you
should rename it to be 'skinnableWidgets'. These changes are due to
the introduction of the global widget customization feature.
Please see the guide (the "Theming" section) for more details.

- CAutoComplete is now deprecated and will be removed in Yii 1.2. Consider
using CJuiAutoComplete.

- Now it's not possible to reuse CActiveFinder. So if you have code like this:

  $finder = Post::model()->with('comments');
  $posts1 = $finder->findAll();
  …
  $posts2 = $finder->findAll();

  you should rewrite it to:

  $posts1 = Post::model()->with('comments');
  …
  $posts2 = Post::model()->with('comments');

- The 'condition' declared in the scopes of the related AR classes will now
be put in the 'ON' clause of the JOIN statement when performing relational AR queries.


Upgrading from v1.1.1
---------------------

Upgrading from v1.1.0
---------------------
- CHtml::beginForm() will automatically generate hidden fields to represent
the parameters in the query string when the form uses GET method.
To avoid submitting duplicated query parameters, you may use createUrl()
to explicitly specify the action of the form. You may also need to remove
the hidden fields that you previously render for the same purpose.

- The code generated by yiic tool is changed. If you are using yiic tool
to generate new CRUD code on a previously generated skeleton, you are recommended
to run "yiic webapp" again to re-generate the skeleton. Make sure you backup
your work before you do this.

- CMenu now renders the 'active' CSS class for the 'li' tag instead of the
hyperlink tag. You should adjust your CSS code accordingly if you use CMenu
in your application.

- CUrlManager::parsePathInfo() is changed to be non-static. If you override
this method or your existing code calls this method directly (neither is common),
you need to change your code accordingly.

- CController::forward() will exit the application by default now. If you want
to keep the old behavior, you may pass false as the second parameter.

- The jQuery copy included in the framework has been upgraded to version 1.4.2.
This may cause some incompatibility problems to your existing jQuery code or plugins.
If you want to keep using version 1.3.2, you may do so by configuring
CClientScript::scriptMap property.

- The default theme for JQuery UI widgets was changed from 'smoothness' to 'base'.
If you are using 'smoothness', you will need to manually download this theme from
jqueryui.com and configure the 'theme' property of the JQuery UI widgets accordingly.


Upgrading from v1.1rc
---------------------
- CRudColumn is renamed as CButtonColumn
- CDataColumn.dataField and dataExpression are renamed as name and value, respectively
- The alias name for the primary table in an AR query is fixed to be 't'

Upgrading from v1.1b
--------------------

Upgrading from v1.1a
--------------------
- CSort::attributes is changed. Now the array keys refer to attribute names
and array values refer to virtual attribute definitions. Please read the
API documentation for this property to learn more details. This change will
affect your code only when you explicitly specify this property.

Upgrading from v1.0.x
---------------------
- Application and module parameter names are changed to be case-sensitive.
In 1.0.x, they are case-insensitive.

- For tabular input, using Field[$i] is not valid anymore. Attribute names
should look like [$i]Field in order to support array-typed fields
(e.g. [$i]Field[$index]).

- Please read the Guide for further details on how to upgrade from v1.0.x to v1.1.

Upgrading from v1.0.12
----------------------

Upgrading from v1.0.11
----------------------

Upgrading from v1.0.10
----------------------

Upgrading from v1.0.9
---------------------

Upgrading from v1.0.8
---------------------
- ActiveRecord lazy loading is changed for optimization purpose. Previously,
when lazy loading occurs, the related table will be joined with the primary
table. Now, the related table will be queried without joining the primary table.
As a result, if you are using lazy loading and the corresponding relation
declaration includes reference to the primary table, the query will fail.
To fix this problem, please specify the lazy loading query options with the
actual primary table column values.

Upgrading from v1.0.7
---------------------
- A directory imported using Yii::import() will have precedence over
any existing include paths. For example, if we import 'application.models.*',
then the corresponding directory will be searched before any other
existing include paths. This also means, a directory imported later will
have precedence over directories imported earlier. Previously, this order
was reversed. This change may affect you if you have several classes with
the same name and they are imported via different directories. You will need
to adjust the import order of these directories to make sure your existing
applications are not broken due to this change.


Upgrading from v1.0.6
---------------------
- Default named scope will no longer be applied to INSERT, UPDATE and
DELETE queries. It is only applied to SELECT queries. You should be aware
of this change if you override CActiveRecord::defaultScope() in your code.

- The signature of CWebUser::logout() is changed. If you override this method,
you will need to modify your method declaration accordingly.


Upgrading from v1.0.5
---------------------


Upgrading from v1.0.4
---------------------
- CWebUser::checkAccess() takes an additional parameter to allow caching
the access check results. If you override this method, you will need to
modify your method declaration accordingly. Because the new parameter will
enable caching the access check results by default, please double check
your code containing this method call to make sure the behavior is as expected.

- CDateParser has been renamed to CDateTimeParser


Upgrading from v1.0.3
---------------------
- The signature of CWebModule::init() is modified. Its parameter is removed.
  If your application uses modules, you have to modify your module class
  files accordingly.


Upgrading from v1.0.2
---------------------
- Controllers that are organized in subdirectories are now referenced
  using the ID format "path/to/xyz". Previously it was "path.to.xyz".
  If you use "path.to.xyz" in your application, you have to modify it
  to "path/to/xyz".

- CHtml::coreScript() is removed. If you used this in your application,
  please use the following alternative:

  Yii::app()->clientScript->registerCoreScript($name);


Upgrading from v1.0.1
---------------------
- Due to the introduction of the scenario-based massive assignment feature,
  we removed CActiveRecord::protectedAttributes(). Please use safeAttributes()
  to specify which attributes are safe to be massively assigned.

  For more details about scenario-based assignment and validation,
  please read the following tutorial section:

  http://www.yiiframework.com/doc/guide/form.model#securing-attribute-assignments

- The signature of CModel::validate() has been changed to:

  CModel::validate($scenario='', $attributes=null)

  That is, the order of the two parameters has been swapped. If your application
  contains code that invokes the validate() method (of either a CFormModel
  or a CActiveRecord object) with some parameter, please make sure you fix
  the parameter order.

- The usage of CActiveRecord::with() and the 'with' option in relations
  has been changed. In order to query child relations, we should specify the 'with'
  parameter/option like the following now:

  Post::model()->with(array('comments', 'author.profile'))->findAll();

  Previously, this should be written as:

  Post::model()->with(array('comments', 'author'=>'profile'))->findAll();

  If your code does not involve child relations (like 'profile' in the above),
  nothing needs to be changed.

  This change has been introduced in order to support dynamic relational
  query options. For example, we can specify that comments be sorted in
  descending order (assuming in the relations() method it is specified as
  ascending order):

  Post::model()->with(array(
      'comments'=>array('order'=>'createTime DESC'),
      'author.profile',
  ))->findAll();


Upgrading from v1.0.0
---------------------
- An $scenario parameter is added to both CModel::beforeValidate() and afterValidate().
  If you override these methods in your child classes (form models, AR classes),
  make sure you change the method signature accordingly.
