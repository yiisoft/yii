         Upgrading Instructions for Yii Framework v1.1
         =============================================

!!!IMPORTANT!!!

The following upgrading instructions are cumulative. That is,
if you want to upgrade from version A to version C and there is
version B between A and C, you need to following the instructions
for both A and B.

Upgrading from v1.0.0
---------------------
- An $on parameter is added to both CModel::beforeValidate() and afterValidate().
  If you override these methods in your child classes (form models, AR classes),
  make sure you change the method signature accordingly.
