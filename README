Yee Web Programming Framework
=============================

Thank you for choosing Yee - a high-performance component-based PHP framework.

directory. You shall see the following files and directories:

      demos/               demos
      framework/           framework source files

REQUIREMENTS
------------

The minimum requirement by Yee is that your Web server supports
PHP 5.1.0 or above. Yee has been tested with Apache HTTP server
on Windows and Linux operating systems.

Please access the following URL to check if your Web server reaches
the requirements by Yee, assuming "YeePath" is where Yee is installed:

      http://hostname/YeePath/requirements/index.php


QUICK START
-----------

Yee comes with a command line tool called "yeec" that can create
a skeleton Yee application for you to start with.

On command line, type in the following commands:

        $ cd YeePath/framework                (Linux)
        cd YeePath\framework                  (Windows)

        $ ./yeec webapp ../testdrive          (Linux)
        yeec webapp ..\testdrive              (Windows)

The new Yee application will be created at "YeePath/testdrive".
You can access it with the following URL:

        http://hostname/YeePath/testdrive/index.php
