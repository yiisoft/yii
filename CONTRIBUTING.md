When contributing to Yii you have to follow some conventions and a simple
workflow. It allows us to handle the requests quickly and ensure best quality
for the Yii core code.

Following guidelines will result in less work for both you and the core team.

Contributing code and fix bugs
------------------------------

Please take the time and read the following guide from beginning to the end:
https://github.com/yiisoft/yii/wiki/Git-workflow-for-Yii-contributors

For code style see:
https://github.com/yiisoft/yii/wiki/Core-framework-code-style

A common issue for many pull requests is inconsistent line endings. You can
learn about dealing with it at:
https://help.github.com/articles/dealing-with-line-endings

**Thanks for your contribution!**

Contributing translations
-------------------------

Contributing translations does not have a workflow like with code. You don't
need to create an issue, pull request will be enough.
