/**
 * CUploadedFile represents the information for an uploaded file.
 *
 * Call {@link getInstance} to retrieve the instance of an uploaded file,
 * and then use {@link saveAs} to save it on the server.
 * You may also query other information about the file, including {@link name},
 * {@link tempName}, {@link type}, {@link size} and {@link error}.
 *
 * @property string $name The original name of the file being uploaded.
 * @property string $tempName The path of the uploaded file on the server.
 * Note, this is a temporary file which will be automatically deleted by PHP
 * after the current request is processed.
 * @property string $type The MIME-type of the uploaded file (such as "image/gif").
 * Since this MIME type is not checked on the server side, do not take this value for granted.
 * Instead, use {@link CFileHelper::getMimeType} to determine the exact MIME type.
 * @property integer $size The actual size of the uploaded file in bytes.
 * @property integer $error The error code.
 * @property boolean $hasError Whether there is an error with the uploaded file.
 * Check {@link error} for detailed error code information.
 * @property string $extensionName The file extension name for {@link name}.
 * The extension name does not include the dot character. An empty string
 * is returned if {@link name} does not have an extension name.
